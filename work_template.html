            <h1>Project information</h1>
            <p>In early 13th century in Korea, about 200 years earlier than the invention of Gutenberg Bible, the
                complete set of a Buddhist canon known as the Tripitaka Koreana was printed. It is considered as the
                oldest and the most complete collection of Buddhist texts which reflects the printing technology in the
                13th century. The woodblocks used for printing are conserved and preserved in the temple Haeinsa, which
                is registered as a UNESCO world heritage.

                Despite its significance in the history of typography and printing technology, Haeinsa and the
                woodblocks are not widely known. This project is a concept exhibition about the Haeinsa at the RISD
                museum in order to introduce the history of Eastern printing press.</p>

                <p>Haeinsa is located in South Korea. However, when the woodblocks were made during the 13th century, which is almost 200 years earlier than the invention of Korean writing system 'Hangul', Koreans used Chinese characters as their writing system. In order to show all three (Chinese, Korean, and English) culture and languages, I picked Spoqa Han Sans which supports all three and also both web and prints. The Electra Std was also used as a main and display typeface for the branding to be consistent with the delicacy of engraved Chinese characters.</p>
